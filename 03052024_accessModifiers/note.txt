Static Modifiers :
    1.Static variable
    2.Static method
    3.Static block
    4.Static class


1. Static variable:
    but a static variable allocate memory once and this memory can be access throught all object    
    static variable also called class variable

2. Static Method:
    A static method does not need object creation for its calling it can be call directly using 
    the class name a static method can access only static variable and variable which is declare
    inside the static method, implicitly declared as static
    Calling a static variable and method:
        class_name.static_method_name
        class_name.static_variable_name

    WAP to create class Circle now input value of radius and compute area and circumference.
    in this program impliment all method as static

3.
    As we know that execution of program is started from main method, if a class contain static block,
    then static block is executed before main method.
    if a class contain more then one static block then all static blocks from top-to-bottom are executed
    before main method.
    static block is basically use to initialize static variable, so in sum other programming languages
    it is also called static constructor.
    Static block can access only static variable and a variable which is declare inside static block,
    implicitly declared as static.

    syntex:
        static{
            statements
            ...
            ..
            .
        }
example:

public class StaticBlock {
    static int a = 20;
    static {
        System.out.println("this is static Block1");
    }

    StaticBlock() {
        System.out.println("this is staticBlock Constructor");
    }

    static {
        System.out.println("this is static Block2");

    }

    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("this is static method");
        System.out.println("A :" + a);
    }

    static {
        staticMethod();
        System.out.println("this is static block 3");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Starting main() method");
        new StaticBlock().staticMethod();
    }
    static{
        System.out.println("This is static Block 4");
    }
}
