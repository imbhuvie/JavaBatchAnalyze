Polymorphism:
    poly(many) + Morphism(forms)
    one name and its multiple form are called Polymorphism
    in Polymorphism using single component we can perform more then one operation
    all the concept of Polymorphism are implimented in the context of method
    Polymorphism also called binding in OOPs
  There are 2 types of Polymorphism
    1.CompileTimePolymorphism(Static)(check by compile)(early binding)
    2.RunTimePolymorphism(Dynamic)(Checked by JVM)(Late Binding)

1.CompileTimePolymorphism(Static)(check by compile)()
    In this all the used method should be bind in the time of compilation that why it is also called early Binding
    There are 3 types of compile time Polymorphism :-
    1.Method Overloading
    2.Constructor Overloading
    3.Operator Overloading
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Method Overloading: 
        Method Overloading allow to having two or more methods with same name
        and different number of argument and datatype of argument and sequence of argument.
        In this all the used method should be bind at the time of compilation.

Example of MethodOverloading:

public class Test{
    void sum(int x,int y){
        
    }
    void sum(int x,int y,int z){//number of argument

    }
    void sum(int x,float y){//datatype of argument

    }
    void sum(float x, int y){//sequence of argument

    }
}

---------------------------------------
2.Constructor Overloading : if a class contain more than one Constructor that is know as constructor overlaoding

    WAP to table of any number by appropriate use of constructor overloading
    WAP to print AP series if value are a,d,n are initialised using constructor(implimente constructor overloading)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.OperatorOverloading : 
    OperatorOverloading means we can assign new definition for an existing Operator
    Java Does not support OperatorOverloading programming due to security
    but there are 2 operator which are already OperatorOverloaded
        1. + is used for addition and concatenation
        2. - is used for subtraction and unary minus operation (-12,-34 etc)

Example of OperatorOverloading:

public class OperatorOverloading{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int a=10,b=20;
        String c="10",d="20";
        System.out.println(a+b);//Addition
        System.out.println(c+d);//concatenation
        System.out.println(b-a);//binary minus
        System.out.println(-b);//unary minus
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WAP to compute area of following shape using method overloading
1.AreaOf square
2.AreaOf rectangle
3.Areaof trinagle
4.Area of circle
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
find largest between 2 and 3 using method overloading.
