MethodOverriding :
        Method Overriding allow to having a method that have same prototype in base and derived class
        that means, A base class method is redefined by derived class. 
        Here the definition of base class method is hidden by derived class method definition.
        In MethodOverriding all the used method should be bind at the time of execution of program
        Its reason thats why it is called runtime Polymorphism or late binding or Dynamic 
        
WAP to create a Class Series that contains three attributes a,d,n and
two method getData and printSeries
Now create two subClasses APSeries and GPSeries to print respective series by overriding printSeries() method

Property of super Keyword in context of method:
        using super keyword we can get the actual definition of base class method which is overridden by derrived class

Difference between MethodOverloading and MethodOverriding:

1.  MethodOverloading is applicable in same class
    MethodOverriding is applicable in inheritance

2.  In MethodOverloading, two or more method has same name but different argument.
    In MethodOverriding, two or more method same name and same argument.

3   In MethodOverloading, used method should be bind at the time of compilation
    In MethodOverriding, used method should be bind at the time of execution

Modifiers:
    Modifiers contains set of rules that can modified the propertis of variable,method,class
    There are 8 modifiers in java and four access-modifiers.
    Modifiers:--
        abstract
        static
        final
        synchronized
        transient
        volatile
        native
        strictfp
    Access-Modifiers:--
        private
        default(No Modifiers)
        protected
        public

    Note: Modifiers are also keyword.

Abstract Modifiers:
    1.Abstract method:(Declarative method)
        An abstract method cannot have definition body inside base class, it can have only declaration inside base class.
        Here Abstract method always overridden by derived class.
        At the time of declaration of an abstract method we must use abstract keyword but at the time of overrid an abstract mehtod,
        we should not use abstract keyword.
    2.Abstract class:
        An abstract class is an incomplete class that can not instantiated, that is we cannot create object of abstract class.So abstract always inherited by other class.
        A class that extends abstract class, it must override all abstract method of abstract class otherwie it should be compile time Exception
