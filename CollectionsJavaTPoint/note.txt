Collection:A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.
    The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of object
    Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
    Java Collection means a single unit of objects. 
    Java Collection framework provides many interfaces:
            Set
            List 
            Queue 
            Deque 
    and classes:
            ArrayList 
            Vector
            LinkedList 
            PriorityQueue 
            HashSet
            LinkedHashSet
            TreeSet
