Interface:

    Interface is pure abstract class that can not have its 'object', while abstract class also can cannot have object.
    There is basic difference between abstract class and Interface, that abstract class can have both declare and difinition of the method
    An Interface can have declaration of method.
    Note: An Interface is also called pure abstract class.
    Properties of Interface:
        1.interface constructor: An interface does not contains constructor neither implicit nor explicit
        2.interface variable: An interface variable implicitly assign three modifiers:
                                1.public
                                2.static
                                3.final
        3.interface method: An interface method implicitly assign these modifiers.
                                1.public 
                                2.abstract
    
Note 1: An interface declared using 'interface' keyword, and it should be completed by a class using 'impliments' keyword
Note 2. A class that impliments an interface, it must 'override' all the methods of interface otherwise it show compile time exception.
Note 3. A class that override the methods of interface, then we must use 'public' modifier at the time of override with interface methods,
        otherwise it show weaker access error.

Multiple Inheritance:
    Multiple inheritance can be implimented using interface, There are three ways to impliment multiple inheritance:
    1.  it is allow that we can extends the class and impliments an interface at a time,
        this is also called implimentation of multiple inheritance using interface
        
    2. A class can impliments 2 or more interfaces at a time. this is also called multiple inheritance.
    Example:
            interface A{

            }
            interface B{

            }
            class C{

            }
            class D extends C impliments A,B{

            }
    3. A interface can extend 3 or more interfaces at same time.
        Example:
            interface A{

            }
            interface B{

            }
            interface C extends A,B{

            }
            class D extends C{
                //Here class D must override all the methods of interface C, 
                //and C extends A,B so also we override all the methods of A,B interface
                //overall you must override methods of interface C,B,A .
            }
