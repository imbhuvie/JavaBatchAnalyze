Inheritance:
    Reusability of code is called Inheritance.
    Inheritance we can reuse properties of one class by another class .
    In Inheritance all the use classes can we classified into 2 types
        1. BaseClass/superClass/parentClass
        2. DerivedClass/childClass/subClass

Types of Inheritance:
   There r 5 types of Inheritance
   1. Single Inheritance
   2. Hirarchial Inheritance
   3. Multiple Inheritance (Does not support)
   4. MultiLevel Inheritance
   5. Hybrid Inheritance

1. Single Inheritance :
    THis type of Inheritance contains single BaseClass and single DerivedClass
    NOTE    1: extends keyword is used to inherit propertise of one class to another class 
               private variable and method never inherit.
               Inheritance is Bottum to Top programming approach.

2. Hirarchial Inheritance:
    In this we can inherit the properties of one class by 2 or more classes.

3. Multiple Inheritance (Does not support):
    In this we can inherit properties of 2 or more classs by a single class.
    Note : Java does not support multiple Inheritance due to constructor calling in Inheritance,
           but multiple Inheritance in java can be implimented with the help of Interface.

4. MultiLevel Inheritance:
    An Inheritance that have minimum 2 level called MultiLevel Inheritance

5. Hybrid Inheritance:
    The combination of multiple and MultiLevel Inheritance called Hybrid Inheritance


WAP to create class that series that have 3 attribute a,d,n it contains method input,
now create 2 subclasses AP Series and GP series, to print respective series;

WAP to create a class Shape that contains 2 child and input for input and now create 2 subclasses
rectangle and tringle to compute respective areas.
